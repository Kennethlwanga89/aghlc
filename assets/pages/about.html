      <h2>About Amaizing Grace Hope Living Church Nalyamagonja</h2>
      <p>The lord has a burden upone Pastor Harriet Serunjoji and pastor Joel Serunjoji to help people encounter God's presence through the power of the holy spirit.
        In 1998 Amaizing Grace Hopeliving church was planted in obedience to the voice and call of God. </p>
</div>

<div class="history">
<h2>Church History</h2>
<p>
  Amazing Grace Hope Living Church  started as an apostolic church because the leader of the time had hoped that the apostolic Ministry of Bishop Kamya would offer him support. He had served in the same ministry. God brought Br. Male, Br. Samson Bumba from Eden Revival Church Kanyanya branch in 1998, and Br. Kakutu a Mukonjo from Kasese.
By then, the community regarded the Church as Kiberu’s shrine. It was fully based on the family. The pastor an elder brother (Pr. Kiberu), his brother Bathremew Seggane was deacon, his other brother Kiwanuka Nsubuga Charles also a deacon, as the wife was an elder, his other “Balamus” sisters in law were sheep and choir leaders.  
Pr. Harriet by then was prayer leader. Led by the spirit of God, we went to Miracle Valley Ministry for parenting where we were welcomed with open hearts, the new people who joined church started believing God for the changes  that must make the church go beyond the family level. In early 1999, there was disintegration of the group- some went to Nalumuli, others to other places. Pastor Kiberu remained alone with his wife and Elder Harrriet Nakyeyune. 
 We changed our address to Nalyamagonja Miracle Valley Church, Paul Kiviiri was marvelous. He loved us and we started relating with Pastor Paddy of Nakasongola,Rev. Racheal Iwagira, Pr. Serunkuuma and many others. Thank you for being there for us.
In late 2000, Pr. Kiberu left for Kiboga without bidding farewell to the the church.
Pastor Male took us through 2001 but also left us to Kikyusa for ministry which we had prayed for for over four years. ( this is how seek God for guidance) we were led to fast , and ask God for another pastor after 200days of prayer, Pr. Harriet receives a vision of the ministry.
We continued nursing the BABY Amazing Grace Ministry while under Miracle valley church, after several meetings of how to renew the ministry of Miracle Valley, the leaders hit a rock and were willing to continue with unrenewed Ministry. We requested for permission to leave and nurture Amazing Grace and it was granted to us.
It was after this that we registered for Amazing Grace Ministry but the name had been registered by others. This required us to add Hope living Church Nalyamagonja and currently AMAZING GRACE MIRACLE VALLEY CHURCH.
As told by Pr Harriet.
